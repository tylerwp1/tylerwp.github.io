    <p>	Methods and Measurements </p>
    <p>
      Simulations:
For simulations, PossionSuperfish was used, a magnetic field modeling software developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Given the dimensions of a magnet, material of magnet and surrounding pieces, the magnetic field surrounding the apparatus will be produced.
Plots were then created that show the magnitude of the magnetic field as  a function of position, with emphasis on the fringe field’s behavior. 
In order to ensure the most accurate model, a return path had to be implemented, with various distances away from the magnet being tested to see which matched the previous model and real data the most. 

Observations/Measurements:
Actual measurements of the Harvey-Wells magnet had to be made to ensure the models were accurate. The measurements were made at TUNL, using a set of 11 Hall probes that travelled though the magnetic field taking magnitude measurements at each centimeter.

<p>	Results and Discussion </p>
      <p> After running simulations for return paths varying from -100 cm to 190 cm, the resulting fringe fields never fit the real data as closely as desired. 
All of the simulations produced fringe field curves that did not appear to trend towards fitting the real data. 
Trying the return path at negative values (left of the magnet) produced an odd plot, which was discarded.
After seeing that varying the return path had little affect on the modeled field matching the real data, it is assumed that the return path has not affect of the differences in the fringe field when compared to the real data or 3 dimensional model.
We assumed that the slight difference in fringe field is not due to the return path’s existence, but more so due to the software’s inconsistencies and age.
Instead of the 2 dimensional fringe field being modeled via PoissionSuperfish it has been decided that we will attempt to model it via a polynomial fit in the future.
