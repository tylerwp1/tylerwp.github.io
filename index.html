      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are Cross Writers! Here in our very neat blog, we are passionate about the success of young, buddling writers! So, in order to do so, what we do is: read, comment, and give constructed criticism to pieces. So, about us here in Cross Writers, we are all professional writers who graduated from college with an English Major. We were inspired to create this website by witnessing the difficulty of managing to get one of our works published. The editing process can sometimes be brutal. Thus, we decided to create a way to simplify the editing process by having it done here, by multiple people at one time.
