      <h2>January: The Introduction of Buer Asmodeus</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Buer Asmodeus always knew what he wanted and have always gotten it. He enjoys his job and is good at it. He watches houses. Who lived there and when they left. Writing down the times of when the parents came and go and when the children left for and returned from the bus. It’s an easy job and it pays well. It doesn’t matter what his contractors did with the information. He didn’t do anything wrong, he would tell himself as he wrote down another observation. All he did was some simple surveillance and forwarded it along. It didn’t matter to him that sometimes people in large black vans came when the house was empty, save for some unfortunate soul and take them away, and one of them would nod towards his direction, which was the signal to drive away. He didn’t do anything wrong. He wasn’t the one who picked the lock or break the windows or go to the children’s room and take them or tie them up or blindfolded and gagged them or tortured them when the parents refused to pay. All he did was watch and take notes. It wasn’t his fault that sometimes the information would be used. He didn’t partake in any of it, except for the occasional romp here and there. His employers ensured his simple pleasures. Money was never an issue, and sometimes, even, they would let him have his way with one of the girls if the family missed a payment as punishment. Even then, it was near and far in-between. That was how he justified it, he never actually involved himself with the kidnapping – that was until he saw her.
