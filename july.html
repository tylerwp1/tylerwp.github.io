      <h2>July: Letter of Recommendation</h2>
      </div>
    <h3>April 4th, 2019</h3> 

    <h3>To Whom It May Concern:</h3>

<p>It is my honor to write a letter of recommendation for Matt Clark for the assistant coach of the year award.</p>
    
<p>I’ve known coach Clark for almost two years now. Throughout our time together, he did not merely just become a great coach; he also became a dear friend.</p>
<p>I first met coach Clark at the beginning of my junior year. At the time, our team was going through a coaching change and a transition period. Coach Clark took a leap of faith and left his head coaching position at UNCW and came on staff as our assistant coach. Immediately, coach Clark reached out to every one of us and made an effort to connect with us on a more personal level. I remember my first phone call with coach Clark. It was the week before left for school my junior year. I called him to introduce myself and welcome him to the Carolina family. We started chatting about my golf game and what I was working on. I told him that I am trying to separate the course from the range and that I am working on improving my mental game in tournaments. I will never forget what his responds was. He said, “After you get here, whenever you have time, lets get out on the golf course and play 18 holes. I may not know much about your golf game right now but I am going to try my best to get to know you and your golf game as fast as I can so I can better help you improve.”</p>
<p>As a man of his words, coach Clark got to know each and every one of us personally. It takes a good coach to win tournaments, but it takes a great coach, and a great person, to be respected by your players. After two years with our program, I can say with confidence coach Clark has earned the respect of every person who is involved with our program. There are many hard working coaches in college golf, but there are few that truly care about their players the way coach Clark cares about us. There is no one more deserving of this award than coach Matt Clark.</p>


    <p>Respectfully,</p>
    <p>Tailin Song</p>
