    <p>Dear Recruiting Manager,</p>
    <p>I write this letter to express my sincere interest in your Marketing Internship opportunity this summer. I had previously heard about this opening as being part of the Tar Heel Career Training Camp. When I saw that the Teamworks internship was no longer available in the training camp I went on your website to learn more. This internship really sparked my interest because I found out that many of the core values that I carried for myself were also emphasized by Teamworks, including thoughtfulness and commitment. Upon seeing the listing online, I knew that this was an experience that I could not pass on. 
    </p>
    <p>I had originally been introduced to Teamworks when our golf team started using the platform a couple of years ago. I was amazed with the capability of its various applications. The Marketing Internship interests me because it combines two of my passion points; sports and strategic-thinking. Recently, I have been accepted into graduate school to receive a MSc in Marketing at the University of Nottingham. I thought this internship would provide a great opportunity to gain experience in the field before I started the program. In addition, seeing how Teamworks was voted “2018 Best Places to Work” by Triangle Business Journal, I thought that this would be a best place to work, showing that it places emphasis on its employees and their development. </p>
    <p>I think that I would be a great fit for the Marketing Intern position because I demonstrate all of the traits that Teamworks values. Among these, resiliency really resonates with me. Last year, I started the second semester struggling to perform in tournaments. I had worked my way back into our team’s individual spot where I had played well for two tournaments. Eventually, post-season was upon us starting with our conference tournament. However, I was not even given a chance to qualify for it which was extremely disappointing for me. I accepted the challenge at hand and put my head down and worked relentlessly for the next few weeks. The week leading into regionals I earned my spot into the starting lineup where I finished in the top 15 to help our team advance to the National Championship. I believe that by displaying resiliency and many more traits I could be a valuable asset to Teamworks.</p>
    <p>I would appreciate the opportunity for an interview to further discuss my qualifications. I think the alignment of our core values would make me a perfect fit for the position. Feel free to contact me at (919) 675-9373 or johndoe@gmail.com at your convenience. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,
John Doe</p>
