      <h2>May: Article Review</h2>
      </div>
      <p>In Reason and rule of faith in the second century AD, Osborn explains the rule of faith and uses arguments for believing it through Christian authors, Tertullian, Clement, and Irenaeus. The rule of faith was of ultimate authority to Christianity and referred to creeds that were written during the first few centuries after Christ. The authors’ arguments for the validity of the rule of faith included the power of preaching, truth, and Christ. The central question that this chapter attempts to answer is: Was the chief concern to limit reason to make room for faith or to use faith to make room for reason (Osborn, 40).
</p>
    <p>Irenaeus believed that the rule of faith can be determined by what was believed and preached by Christians and the apostles. The first reason to accept the rule of faith according to Irenaeus is because it is recorded history that is public and can be confirmed. Irenaeus notes that the succession of churches receiving one apostolic truth that was passed down through Rome can be traced (Osborn, 49). In addition, other churches provided evidence which supported these claims (Osborn, 49). This evidence shows that the apostles’ preaching can be trusted because it is historical and can be traced back to the life of Jesus. 
    </p>
    <p>The importance of truth was the main argument that Clement made for the rule of faith. He says “the only basis for knowledge is belief in the first principles contained in the rule of the church” (Osborn, 51). Gnostics wanted the knowledge without the faith and simple believers wanted the faith without the knowledge but Clement argues that but are essential for the Christian belief (Osborn, 51). This is similar to how heretics use singular verses of scripture out of context and twist it to mean something it does not (Osborn, 53). Clement explains in detail why the rule of faith is truth and how heretics only can only challenge this through plausibility and obscurity, not logic.</p>
    <p>This chapter was created as an argument to believe in the rule of faith. Irenaeus, Clement, and Tertullian thoroughly provide evidence to have faith in Christ by believing the rule of faith. The authors dispel the myths of heretical challenges of Christianity. Through it, they convincingly provide proof for why heretics are misleading. After sifting through all the arguments, Osborn concludes that the rule used faith to make room for reason.
